I'm like eight foot four, blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents
But I'm still a thug
I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, well I just baked Caramel Delights
T Swift and T Pain rappin' on the same track
It's a thug story tell me can you get with that
I had a dream last night I had high-top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing "I'm on a boat"
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'ma take ya
You can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star
Hey it's a thug story now tell them who you are
Singer turned gangsta
You don't wanna fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee
T Swift and T Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story tell now can you get with that
What! what! I knit sweaters yo!
What! what! don't test me
Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
What? I said "yo"
Yo, you guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
She didn't even swear
Hello? Ugh!
